  <!-- Introduction -->
  <section class="max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-10">
    <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-semibold mb-4">Who is the Youth Council Choir?</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      The origins of the Youth Council (YC) choir at Mary Immaculate Parish (MIP) trace back to the early 1980s. Between 1983 and 1984, Most Rev. Roberto Calara Mallari DD, the current Bishop of the Diocese of Tarlac, initiated efforts to gather the parish's youth. By 1985, Rev. Fr. Pierino Rogliardi continued this mission by introducing the Focolare Movement to a group of young parishioners, marking the official formation of the Youth Council.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      Prominent early members included Bro. Joel Abellanosa and Rene Ferrer. Over time, leadership transitioned to Yuri Alafriz and the succeeding Youth Council Primes, who played pivotal roles in expanding YC's influence. Singing, acting, and dancing became central to YC's activities, encapsulated in their cultural showcases called "Langit-Langitan."
    </p>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed text-justify">
      The evolution of YC took an artistic turn with the emergence of Apostles of Christ Thru Service (ACTS), a group focused on enhancing the parish's aesthetics by displaying the monthly Words of Life, drawn from the Focolare Movement. ACTS later integrated chorister roles, solidifying their musical contributions to the parish.
    </p>
    <p class="leading-relaxed text-justify">
      Today, the Youth Council Choir remains a vital part of Mary Immaculate Parish, engaging 30+ attendees at every Sunday service and having mandatory weekly sectionals and rehearsals. Beyond music, YC fosters spiritual growth through monthly Block Rosary gatherings, one-hour vigils in the adoration chapel, sessions reflecting on the Word of Life, and yearly retreats usually in Tagaytay.
